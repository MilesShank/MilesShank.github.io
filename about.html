                    Hi! I'm Miles! <br> 
                    I am a full stack developer and visual designer. I graduated from Oberlin College in 2017. <br>
                             My degree is in East Asian Studies, but ever since graduation I have been pivoting towards technology and design. 
                                In the past several years, I've designed for video games, limited merchandise runs, and a runway fashion show.
                                Ever since doing work on my first video game project, CROSSNIQ+ for the Nintendo Switch, I have been transitioning from mostly
                                art direction and asset production, to writing actual program code. Designing is something I love, whether it's a charming user interface, 
                                or a cleverly structured back end. <br>
                                In my spare time I love to travel and create in other forms. In college I studied mandarin, so I am always taking any opportunity I can get to practice, at home, or abroad. <br>
                                Aside from languages, I enjoy painting shoes, and designing my own clothing. Identity is important to me and I express that through my hobbies and through my appearance.

                    欢迎来我的个人网站！我的中文名字是苏明朗。我是软件开发人员，还有美工。<br>
                    除了寻常的爱好而外我趁每一个机会练习说中文并且提高我的听说能力。固然在俄亥俄，找到 合适的机会顿时说普通话有点寥落。
                    可想而知在美国中西部回说中文的白种人很稀少。我几次无意把有些中国留学生和游人震惊了。左右我能够自己享受中国文化。
                    我最喜欢的中国菜是过桥米线和牛肉面。我去过云南的时候我差不多每天吃米线。 广东菜当然很好，可是在我梦里再吃云南菜。<br>
